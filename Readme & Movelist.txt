FAQ:

Q: Who is this character?
A: She is the fighter Class from Dungeon Fighter Online 
   (AKA Dungeon & Fighter)

Q: What should I expect from this character?
A: Gameplay similar to the King Of Fighters series with some mechanics 
   from other series thrown in. There are 4 modes which change what 
   Special and Super moves you can do and also have some minor effect
   on some basic attacks. Combo-ing is quite lenient, I encourage
   you to experiment.

Q: Can I use code from this character?
A: Yes you can. Feel free to poke around and use whatever you want.
   If you could credit me in your works that use my code as well that'd
   be greatly appreciated.
